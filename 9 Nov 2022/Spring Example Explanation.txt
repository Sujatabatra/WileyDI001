Steps for Spring IOC Project
1. Create Java Project
2. Convert Java Project to Maven
3. add spring context dependency in pom.xml
4. create component
5. create configuration file
6. launched SpringContainer by instantiating AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
7. call getBean() method to pick different objects, those are created by Spring Container


===============================================

Spring says : Need not to create objects by yourself,
springContainer ( Object of AnnotationConfigApplicationContext) will create object for you, How?
Spring Container need a configuration file
Configuration file is a Java Class which is annotated with an Annotation @Configuration
Inside that class we create public method to return the object
All methods will be annotated with @Bean inside configuration class, will be called by Spring Container and those  objects will be recognised by the name specified with name attibute of @Bean Annotation like this @Bean(name="object Name")

How we can use the objects created by Spring Container
Launch SpringContainer by instantiating AnnonationConfigApplicationContext(ConfigurationFile)
call getBean("ObjectName") method of AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
